<p>This is my week two blog talking about engineering class. This week we are working with tinkercad and making designs of things. For example, we worked on a little machine thing that is supposed to use different objects to pop a balloon. Another thing we did was use an image of something and we made that thing in tinkercad. I don't think I have learned much in this class but I know I will have fun. When the judges were looking at our tinkercad, I thought I would win, but I did not. The person that won made a Nintendo Switch that was pretty cool, but I don't think it was as cool as my baby minion and I'm pretty sure it did not take as long as mine. I'm not gonna try so hard next time and I am not going to expect to win. <img src="Screenshot 2022-09-27 4.54.09 PM"></p>
<p> This is my week three blog of talking about engineering class. This week we worked on our Rube Goldberg Machines. We also did our challenge three project. We made an E and made measurements. We then gave that E to another classmate and they had to make a final draft type thing with the E. The person that gave me his E, made his super big. His was 36 inches by 14 inches and it was hard to cut out. He also did not give me very specific instructions, so I had to kind of guess on some of the measurements and it was pretty hard. In the end I did finish it and it was cool. When we picked whos machine we were going to use, everybody picked mine. So now we are using my machine and it is really awesome. <img src="Screenshot 2022-09-27 5.17.48 PM"></p>
<p>This is my week four blog about engineering class. This week we did more work on our rube golberg machines. I think that our design is pretty good and should work. We also did another challenge and we had to make a boat and make it float with weights on it. My group did really bad, but it was fun to see other groups do good. We are done with our rube goldberg machines, but I would like to work a bit more on them. All we really should fix is maybe the pillars holding up the poles that make our pulley system work. We also should get a taller car so that we have a better chance at popping the ballon. To be honest with you, I feel like me and Theo are the only people doing the work. Sure Dylan is bringing stuff but other tha that he is not doing anything. Oh, I almost forgot about Leo. He has done nothing at all. Maybe he's cut some carboard or something, but he has spent most of the time, watching us, talking to people or wandering around. I dont mean to throw them under the bus, but that is how I feel deep down. Other than that, I love having them in my group and they are such good friends. <img src="Screenshot 2022-09-27 5.20.32 PM"></p>
<p> This my week five blog about my amazing engineering class. On wednesday we were supposed to do the map testing but the internet was down for the firt part of class so we did work on our rube golberg projects. For the second part of class, I thought we were going to to regular engineering class stuff, but we did map testing. On friday, we tested our projects and we had some pretty bad luck. For most of the class we were trying to find ways to keep the car going foward and in a straight line and then we tested it but that didnt work. So after testing some more we got a new needle and finnaly it worked and we were so happy. After that, we went to check out the other classes machine and theirs were super different anc complicated. We watched them test, but then decided to leave because Alec would not leave us alone and decided to brag about how he did all of the work and about how if he wasnt in the group they would fail the project. But anyways we got back to class and someone comes up to me asking if he can use my truck. I give it to him and he immediately pops his ballon after failing even more than our group. I was happy to help, but it was just kind of annoying having to get my car out right after I had just put it away. This was a pretty fun week and I cant wait for the next. <img src="Screenshot 2022-09-27 5.12.57 PM"></p>
<p>This is my week six blog about my enginnering class. This week we did not work on our Rube Golberg project so that means we did something else. We took apart old chromebooks that were already broken. I was with Theo and we worked together pretty well. He oppened up the slides and told me how to take it apart and we finished that up pretty fast. Then he gave me the chromebook so that I could tell him how to take it apart. After we finished, we watched Dylan and Leo do their chromebook. They were breaking pieces left and right and had no idea what they were doing since they didnt even look at the slides. I love watching them work together because it is so funny when they start doing things theyre not sopposed to do. The were so lost that they even taped the hardrive back in place. <img src="Screenshot 2022-10-06 11.21.18 AM"></p>
<p>This is my week seven blog about my goofy engineering class. This week we did some weird things. We made some animal prosthetics and that was quite interesting. I made an arm for a tick so that they can grab onto their victim and suck them without any issues. Theo made a prosthetic for a monkey that uses their nose to make their mating call and stuff. Leo made a dog leg even though the teacher said that cat and dog prosthetics were not allwed. Dylan made a leg for this big stork thing. It was called the shoebill stork and it is very scary. All he did to make the prosthetic was look up leg on tinkercad and there was a premade shape. Later that week, we did a peanut butter and jelly challenge. We had to write instructions on how to make one and out classmates had to follow those instructions exacly and make the sandwitch. It was super funny to watch the people at the beginning, but then it just got kindof boring and annoying.<img src="Screenshot 2022-10-07 12.12.58 PM"</p>
